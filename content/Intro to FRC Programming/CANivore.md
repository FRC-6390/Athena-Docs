The CANivor is a very useful device that helps you expand the communication line for your robot, for instnace creating to CAN loops one for your drivebase and the other could control the rest of your subsystems. This is done in order to relief the load on a loop and decrease the wiring length as if it gets to long the signal wont have enough time to travel back to your Roborio hence causing problems with your robot.
