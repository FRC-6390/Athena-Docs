The Radio on your robot is how the information from your laptop gets to the robot wirelessly

## Programming the Radio
You will need to download the official radio configuration tool [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html), this page also includes all the steps you need to set up your radio for development

## Getting Ready for Competition
Your radio will work differently at a competition, it will need to be reprogrammed to connect to the FMS (Field Management System), there should be a station where you can bring your robot to reprogram the radio. This has to be done or else you can not compete
