When it comes to competing in robot competitions it is is incredibly useful to have a secondary point of view for your robot which proves specifically useful when you are unable to see your robot in the field.

#### Point Of View
Point of view is an important factor when it comes to competing, for instance if you were to have an intake system that needs to grab power cells or cargo as seen in the previous years it may seem as if you are positioned propperly to intake when you likely are not. Therfore using cameras can allow for an advantange and allow for a secondary point of view, for more info regarding the programming aspect please visit the programming introduction to [Cameras](/intro-to-frc-programming/camera).

After programming the camera you will then be able to acces it via the FRC Dashboard which we will get into more details about in the Robot [Driver Station](/driver-station/introduction/)

#### Wiring 
When it comes to wiring USB Cameras it is extremely easy as all that is required is that you plug in the USB cable into the the USB port on the Roborio.
