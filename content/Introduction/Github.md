#### Pushing/Pulling on Github
The “Git Pull” command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.   

The “Git Push” command is used to upload your local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to  a remote repository, so that others can acces your recent changes and merge togather.

#### Merging on GitHub
Git Merging will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent cases Git Merge is used to combine two different branches   

A common example is if Person 1 Changed the same line of code as Person 2 in different branches, this will result in a Merge Conflict if you try to pull each others code, to fix this you would have to resolve the merge conflict and push your code again
