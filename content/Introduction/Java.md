If this is your first time learning Java or are relatively unexperienced we recommend learning from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp). Make sure you properly understand the basic [syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_syntax.asp) and what [methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp) and [conditions](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp) are and how to make them.

### Getting Java Installed

We recommend installing java with the [VS Code Java download](/introduction/vscode/#downloading-vs-code), please make note of the Java version you are downloading. We will be using Java 17 but anything above 11 should work. If your installation version is not above Java 11 or you wish to change it you can download and install Java from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17), the MSI installer should get everything installed and setup for you.
