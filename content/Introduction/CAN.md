CAN is a two wire network that is designed to facilitate communication between multiple devices on your robot. It is recommended that CAN on your robot follow a “daisy-chain” topology. This means that the CAN wiring should usually start at your roboRIO and go into and out of each device successively until finally ending at the PDP.

For more information regarding CAN wiring please visit the WPILIB documentation website, https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html
