	"content": "What is VS Code? Visual Studio Code is an Integrated Development Environment or IDE, An IDE is often a program that programmers use to code and compile projects. Visual Studio Code is a versatile platform and can be used with almost any language. Along with being able to support many languages, it has a large community creating extensions which allow you to personalize, improve workflow, and add more support for even more languages.\nWe will be using Visual Studio code in order to set up our java command-based programming envirnoment.\nDownloading VS Code To get started open the link bellow to download the VS Code installer for your platform. here\rOnce downloaded, run the installer and follow the default installation.\nThe installer will install everything you’ll need, including a java JDK,\nVisual Studio Code and the required java extensions. Downloading WPI Support For FRC To add FRC support to Visual Studio Code, download the following:\nhere\rMake sure you are not downloading a pre-release, The one you download should have a green Latest tag next to the title.\nEach season a new version comes out and you will need to update to that version if you wish to compete.\nThen run the \u0026ldquo;.iso\u0026rdquo; file that you just downloaded and run the Installer.exe program. Choose the skip installing VS Code option as we have already installed it in the previous step above.\nVerifying and Finishing Install Now the that we have finished downloading everything we need to do a few more things before we are free to start programming on Visual Studio Code. First thing we need to check after openning VS Code is if all of our java related tools were installed. Please make sure that the following java extension pack is installed.\nNow please confirm the following:\nCtrl + P, will open the Visual Studio Extensions Command Line, then type\n\u0026gt; java: configure java runtime,\nand verify that you are using a Java version above 11.\nIf you wish to download another version you can download it here\r. Now we need to add the WPI support to Visual Studio Code, because we have only installed it to our system and have not added the proper extension into Visual Studio Code.\nPlease go to this folder within your computer C:\\Users\\Public\\wpilib\\2021\\vsCodeExtensions\nNow open Visual Studio Code and go to extensions, we need to install the WPILib.vsix file into Visual Studio Code. Once in extensions go to the 3 dots and press “Install from VSIX” and install the WPILib.vsix file.\ngif should go here Exploring VS Code File Management Visual Studio Code has lots of way to manage your files, you can open folders through the “Open Folder” option in the Explorer tab on the left.\nYou can also manage your files through the File button on the top of the window\nYou can right click to bring up options within your current folder, like making new folders and files.\nExtensions Visual Studio has lots of extensions, for almost anything you may need\nDisabling and extension will stop it from working\nUninstalling an extension will remove it\nTerminal The terminal is a very useful tool and helps a lot you a lot to find issues within your code by displaying information and errors. The terminal is usually located at the bottom of your screen.\nIf the terminal is missing go to the top left under the Terminal tab and Press create new terminal or ctrl+~\nPersonalization Visual Studio Code has lots of ways to personalize your workflow, check out the extensions and find some themes you think you may like. Personally we use “Material Icons” for our icons and Visual Studio’s built in theme “Abyss”. To change your theme do the following, ctrl + p, to open the Visual Studio Extensions Command Line, then type the following \u0026gt; preferences: Color Theme\n"

	"description": "The wires that give us the power to do amazing things",
	"content": "\nThe CAN Bus is very important and you will most likely find yourself using it quite often as it provides amazing conveniences.\nCAN or Controller Area Network is a standard design to allow devices and microcontrollers to communicate with each other. It uses a pair of wires, typically Green and Yellow. CAN can be configured in 3 ways.\nLine Topology This is where each device connected links to the next device in the line with the end being terminated by a 120 ohm resisitor\nStar Topology This is where all the devices connect to a central hub\nRing Topology This is the same as Line Topology but the end of the line terminates at the point of origin\nWire Lengths Another thing that is very important to keep in mind is how long you make your CAN runs, try not to make any runs longer than 1 foot without a device. Try to keep your runs as short as possible\nOur team typically uses Line Topology, but it is important to know what topology you are using when you are trying to troubleshoot an issue. For example if a motor was acting up and not responding correctly or half the motors on the robot seem to not be working correctly. Knowing the robot uses line typology helps us know that at some point on a line a connection is bad causing everything past it to have a spotty connection too.\nCAN 2.0B Most devices you will encounter use this specific CAN protocol.\nIf your robot has a single CAN bus of this type be careful how many devices you connect to the line, once you start getting into the 10+ motor range you may start to see sperratic behavoir from your CAN devices or outright disconnecting/not working.\nThis is because CAN 2.0B has a major limitation on how much bandwidth is available on the line. The protocol can only hanlde upto 1Mb/s, so be mindful if you causing a lot of updates to your CAN devices.\nThis protocol only allows 8 bytes per frame, which is another limiting factor.\nCAN FD CAN FD greatly increases the amount of data that can be transferred, it allows up 10Mb/s. You will need a seperate device to run this line entirely, for example the CANivore\rThis protocol allows 64 bytes per frame.\nif you would like a more indepth look into CAN check out this\rfrom CTRE\n"

Newer motors coming out may have this built in like the Falcon 500\rbut many still require the speed controller.\nCAN vs PWM Please read up on [CAN] if you are sure about any information portaining to it.\nCAN CAN is a very popular way to connect with your motors and many other systems of your robot CAN devices typically have expanded functionality built in by the manufacturer or vender because the capabilities of CAN are greatly expanded due to the fact that they are able to transfer more indepth information.\nEvery CAN device is required to be assigned an ID, if your robot has multiple CAN busses you will need to specify what bus the motor is on\nPWM PWM is not as popular as a choice due to the fact that the information fed into the device and fed back are limit to only simplie values, do not let that discurage you from using PWM. PWM allows you to have access to the barebones of the motor so you are able to create and configure custom motor classes to your exact liking more easily. This allows you to better control and add feature to motor but with the draw back of more complexity in the code.\nCAN Motor Controllers Here are some examples from popular vendors:\nVictorSPX\rTalonSRX\rPWM Motor Controllers SPARK\rDual Motor Controllers (CAN and PWM) SPARK MAX\r"

	"description": "What are sensors and feedback",
	"content": "Some sensors have native support in WPI, but if you want to features offered by the vendor, you will need to install their custom vendor library.\nAccelerometers Accelerometers measure acceleration (rate of change of velocity), an accelerometer typically uses 3 axes to measure acceleration but some may only measure in one direction. WPI has support for both types of single and tri-axis accelerometers. AnalogAccleromter, ADXL345_I2C, ADXL345_SP, ADXL362 and BuiltInAccelerometer for the Robrio.\nGyroscopes Gyroscopes measure the speed at which an object is turning. Similar to an accelerometer, gyroscopes can be single and tri-axis. WPI has support for gyroscopes but we strongly recommend using the vendor-provided library because they will include quality of life features and capabilities just not found in the WPI library. WPI has support for AnalogGyro, ADIS16448, ADIS16470 and ADXRS450_Gyro. WPI lib does have support for some vendor-specific gyroscopes but, we recommend using the library provided by the vendor itself\nUltrasonic rangefinders Ultrasonic rangefinders find the distance from itself to an object by using ultrasonic sound. WPI does not have much support for this type of sensor and recommends using a vendor-provided library. WPI only supports Ping-response and Analog ultrasonic sensors.\nPotentiometers Potentiometers are variable resistors that measure the voltage of the resistor to find the distance. WPI only has support for one class, AnalogPotentiometer.\nCounters Counters, count! They are often used to measure the number of rotations of a wheel or another rotating object but that job is usually left to an encoder. WPI has support for different counting modes, Two-pulse, Semi-period, Pulse-length, and External direction.\nQuadrature Encoders Quadrature encoders or encoders, often measure the rotation of a wheel or shaft. WPI has great support for encoders but we strongly recommend using any vendor-provided library because they typically come with a whole suite of useful features. WPI has support for a few different decoding modes, 1x, 2x, and 4x.\nLimit Switches Limit switches come in a few different types. Most commonly they will be mechanical/button-like or magnetic. No matter what type you have they all should operate the same, programmatically. WPI does not have a specific class for limit switches but it does include a DigitalInput class where support is provided.\nColour Sensor Colour sensors, sense colour. WPI does not have any support for this type of sensor. We suggest just using the vendor-provided library.\nInertial Measurement Unit (IMU) IMU typically combines multiple sensors that measure acceleration, angular rate and orientation. They do not always include all the listed sensors but most do, they act like an all-in-one including your Accelerometer, Gyroscope and AHRS. WPI does have support for some vendor-specific devices but we recommend using the vendor provided library.\n"

In the image bellow you will see a pnuematic cylinder that is currently in the retreacted state. In most cases when it comes to FRC robots they are used for expanding and retracting intake subsystems, movinf arms, or even pulling or pushing a robot for end game.\nCompressor Pnuematics work by using compressed stored air, but that air has to be collected is some way, therefor we use a compressor such as the one seen bellow.\nAir Tanks Air tanks and tubbing are essential pieces when it comes to working with pneumatic system as the air that is being compressed by the compressor must be stored in some way. Therefor it is important to insure that you have a goo and large enough storage system without any air leaks inorder to be able to use your pneumatic system effectivly.\nControl Module The Pneumatics Control Module (PCM) is a device that is CAN-based which provides you to control your pneumatic devices. The PCM allows you to control up to 8 pneumatic solenoids in order to perform a variety of tasks.\nWiring To find out more details regarding how to wire your pneumatic system please vist the link attached here\rThis is a simple diagram that can show you how to can get started with wiring and the difference between a single and double pneumatic solenoid system.\n"

The installation for the Pheonix Framework can be found here\r.\nAfter installing the tools you will be able to use the Pheonix Tuner in order to interact with CTRE hardware devices, test them, and even settup their firmware version and ID.\nDevice Software Firmware Configuration Now that we have installed the tools required from CTRE it will come with latest device firmwares for all devices at the time, which you be a ble to find on your computer under an FRC folder C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\FRC There are also times where a firmware update is necessary due to a new updates, therefor we will need to download the latest version from the CTRE website\r. Setting Up Your Device After you have completed the above steps you will need to open the Pheonix Tuner desktop application and connect to your robot via a USB Type B which will be connected to your Roborio, then you will want to click \u0026ldquo;Run A Temporary Diagnostic Server\u0026rdquo; Updating Device After running a diagnostic server and getting connected, you will need to head to the second tab on the top left called CAN Devices it may take a few moments to load the devices that are recognised, but once they appear you will want to follow the following steps.\n1) Select the devices you want to update and click\n2) Set the ID of the device you are updating, make sure it does not interfere with any other existing device ID\u0026rsquo;s otherwise you may run into issues\n3) Change the name of the to something you are easily to recognised\n4) Select the proper path to the most recent CRF file, which would be the most recently downloaded firmware found under your FRC folder, please insure you are selecting the firmware for the correct device you are updating\n5) If you are updating the firmware of multiple devices with the same firmware select the option to \u0026ldquo;Update All With Matching Type\u0026rdquo;\n6) Finally press the Update Device button\nNote: incase you run into trouble identifying your device, due to tight spaces or idetical components you can blink each individual device by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Animate LED\u0026rsquo;s and Confirm ID is Correct\u0026rdquo;\n"

Your controller inputs and robot modes also go through Driver Station.\nDriver Station Tour On the left, you will see 5 tabs. Each tab is important and has its own purpose, you will only need to worry about 3 for the majority of your time in Driver Station.\nOperation Tab This tab contains all the required controls to switch your robot mode, you will find yourself most often on this page.\nUSB Devices Tab This tab shows a list of USB devices the robot can see, these devices are connected through your computer. It also shows the device\u0026rsquo;s ID, button inputs and axis values, all of these will be very useful when setting up your controls. If you need to move a device to another spot you can click and drag the device to another slot.\nMessages Tab This tab shows any outputs from the robot, if you are looking for print outs or are looking for a more specific type of output, you can press the gear icon and change what is shown.\nYou can find an in-depth explanation of Driver Station from WPI here\rSetting Your Team Number Head into the 3rd tab and please make sure your Driver Station team number is set correctly or else you will not be able to connect and control the robot\nControls F1 -\u0026gt; Joystick Refresh\n[ or ] or \\ -\u0026gt; Enable Robot\nEnter -\u0026gt; Disable Robot\nSpace -\u0026gt; Emergency Stop\nWhen an emergency stop is triggered, you will need to re-upload the code or reboot the RIO to robot to be able to enable it again keep note that driver station will detect if the space bar is pressed even if it is not focused\nLogs (DS Log File Viewer) This is very important window! This is the tab you go to when all your code is right, the robot has no wiring issues and the networking is setup correctly, or atleast you think it is. This will give you in-depth break down of every single thing your robot is doing, if your CAN is doing things that do not make sense or the networking is acting weird, check this and check their utilizations.\n"
